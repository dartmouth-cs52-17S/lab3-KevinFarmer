# Short Assignment 3

I used npm to set up a dev environment that uses webpack to bundle assets and run a local dev server with hot reloading. I setup babel which is needed for es6 compatibility, and linting to create more formalized style rules (which I'm already enjoying using). The SASS webpack loader is necessary in order to keep our style seperate from webpack package as I understand it, and autoprefixing is setup for cross-browser compatibility. Deployment is also setup to load directly onto github pages.

I think I have a decent understanding of the purpose of each tool, even if I haven't put them into full practice on an actual project yet.

I have the checklist completed.
